# Lab 6's Assignment - Notes

1. The assignment was made in JavaFX. Therefore, all the components (buttons, panels, canvas etc.) are included and described in app.fxml. 
2. Code reading begins both from Main and Controller classes, since Controller handles events in the background and is not explicitly called by Main.
3. Controller class, app.fxml and all the classes in packages Figures and GraphModel contain code for all the sections (Controller for all 3 sections, Figures.CustomEllipse for Optional, Graph for Bonus).
4. All the principal classes (those that are currently used: Main, Controller, all classes in packages Figures and GraphModel) are commented.
5. For the Vertex, Edge and Graph models and the manner of graph drawing I made use of the model presented at the following link: [Chapter 14 - Graphics](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~lanthier/teaching/COMP1406/Notes/COMP1406_Ch14_Graphics.pdf).
6. I've enclosed in this README a gif with the live demo of the drawing application in order to showcase the main functionalities of the program.
