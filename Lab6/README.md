# Lab 6's Assignment - Notes

1. The assignment was made in JavaFX. Therefore, all the components (buttons, panels, canvas etc.) are included and described in app.fxml. 
2. Code reading begins both from Main and Controller classes, since Controller handles events in the background and is not explicitly called by Main.
3. Controller class, app.fxml and RegularPolygon class contain code for the Compulsory section.
4. All the principal classes (those that are currently used: Main, Controller, RegularPolygon) are commented.
